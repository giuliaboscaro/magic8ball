# Magic 8 Ball App
iOS app that simulates the vintage toy Magic 8 Ball, the ideia is that the user aks a question, clicks the button and the Magic 8 Ball shows him an answer.

When the user clicks the "Ask" button the Magic 8 Ball shows a random answer (or maybe it could be destiny? jk).

This app was created through the 6th module of Angela Yu appbrewery's course on Udemy.

# This is the final result
